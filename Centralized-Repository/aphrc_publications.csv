The rise in obesity has led to widespread calls for regular monitoring of changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in all populations. Comparable, up-to-date information about levels and trends is essential to quantify population health effects and to prompt decision makers to prioritise action. We estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980–2013. Methods We systematically identified surveys, reports, and published studies (n=1769) that included data for height and weight, both through physical measurements and self-reports. We used mixed effects linear regression to correct for bias in self-reports. We obtained data for prevalence of obesity and overweight by age, sex, country, and year (n=19 244) with a spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression model to estimate prevalence with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Findings Worldwide, the proportion of adults with a body-mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or greater increased between 1980 and 2013 from 28·8% (95% UI 28·4–29·3) to 36·9% (36·3–37·4) in men, and from 29·8% (29·3–30·2) to 38·0% (37·5–38·5) in women. Prevalence has increased substantially in children and adolescents in developed countries; 23·8% (22·9–24·7) of boys and 22·6% (21·7–23·6) of girls were overweight or obese in 2013. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has also increased in children and adolescents in developing countries, from 8·1% (7·7–8·6) to 12·9% (12·3–13·5) in 2013 for boys and from 8·4% (8·1–8·8) to 13·4% (13·0–13·9) in girls. In adults, estimated prevalence of obesity exceeded 50% in men in Tonga and in women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Tonga, and Samoa. Since 2006, the increase in adult obesity in developed countries has slowed down. Interpretation Because of the established health risks and substantial increases in prevalence, obesity has become a major global health challenge. Not only is obesity increasing, but no national success stories have been reported in the past 33 years. Urgent global action and leadership is needed to help countries to more effectively intervene. Funding Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.","From 1980 to 2013, global obesity prevalence among adults increased significantly. While prevalence has slowed in developed countries since 2006, no countries have reported national success in combating obesity, highlighting the need for urgent global intervention and leadership.","https://openalex.org/A5107896689, https://openalex.org/A5105974687, https://openalex.org/A5013650036, https://openalex.org/A5020811309, https://openalex.org/A5067637394, https://openalex.org/A5039140290, https://openalex.org/A5009638750, https://openalex.org/A5023585266, https://openalex.org/A5022331752, https://openalex.org/A5012390350, https://openalex.org/A5044888998, https://openalex.org/A5112068167, https://openalex.org/A5022723375, https://openalex.org/A5067357766, https://openalex.org/A5033246400, https://openalex.org/A5079694821, https://openalex.org/A5100680450, https://openalex.org/A5017879318, https://openalex.org/A5078832673, https://openalex.org/A5110888093, https://openalex.org/A5000535250, https://openalex.org/A5072175850, https://openalex.org/A5033911261, https://openalex.org/A5088459011, https://openalex.org/A5063906396, https://openalex.org/A5031009188, https://openalex.org/A5038109773, https://openalex.org/A5085837588, https://openalex.org/A5080693617, https://openalex.org/A5081221311, https://openalex.org/A5023059768, https://openalex.org/A5005843863, https://openalex.org/A5108806687, https://openalex.org/A5082383024, https://openalex.org/A5019689738, https://openalex.org/A5103040831, https://openalex.org/A5046431320, https://openalex.org/A5042694620, https://openalex.org/A5032344410, https://openalex.org/A5091864668, https://openalex.org/A5109055704, https://openalex.org/A5089768281, https://openalex.org/A5035870050, https://openalex.org/A5113656294, https://openalex.org/A5052615582, https://openalex.org/A5108084990, https://openalex.org/A5107973303, https://openalex.org/A5065856181, https://openalex.org/A5100633152, https://openalex.org/A5028658441, https://openalex.org/A5031337514, https://openalex.org/A5014800121, https://openalex.org/A5090258107, https://openalex.org/A5068079812, https://openalex.org/A5031889135, https://openalex.org/A5111862360, https://openalex.org/A5106716299, https://openalex.org/A5075065752, https://openalex.org/A5108145341, https://openalex.org/A5031129631, https://openalex.org/A5074928240, https://openalex.org/A5055310842, https://openalex.org/A5044597411, https://openalex.org/A5065323010, https://openalex.org/A5082561940, https://openalex.org/A5080728144, https://openalex.org/A5001558444, https://openalex.org/A5016936793, https://openalex.org/A5059896659, https://openalex.org/A5088103101, https://openalex.org/A5100372590, https://openalex.org/A5061451642, https://openalex.org/A5110488137, https://openalex.org/A5018175714, https://openalex.org/A5077849668, https://openalex.org/A5005970027, https://openalex.org/A5109074641, https://openalex.org/A5033675266, https://openalex.org/A5100391240, https://openalex.org/A5100713957, https://openalex.org/A5100394554, https://openalex.org/A5047104019, https://openalex.org/A5023008381, https://openalex.org/A5086448660, https://openalex.org/A5107836435, https://openalex.org/A5025947251, https://openalex.org/A5014290409, https://openalex.org/A5008504111, https://openalex.org/A5083535850, https://openalex.org/A5108098384, https://openalex.org/A5011259455, https://openalex.org/A5058729777, https://openalex.org/A5107921825, https://openalex.org/A5107834825, https://openalex.org/A5013877984, https://openalex.org/A5037632878, https://openalex.org/A5090564291, https://openalex.org/A5073636956, https://openalex.org/A5008234186, https://openalex.org/A5061152273","Marie Ng, Tom Fleming, Margaret S.

Mace, Robert Marten, Samuel S. Myers, Sania Nishtar, Steven A. Osofsky, Subhrendu K. Pattanayak, Montira J. Pongsiri, Cristina Romanelli, Agnès Soucat, Jeanette Vega, Derek Yach","Far-reaching changes to the structure and function of the Earth's natural systems represent a growing threat to human health. And yet, global health has mainly improved as these changes have gathered pace. What is the explanation? As a Commission, we are deeply concerned that the explanation is straightforward and sobering: we have been mortgaging the health of future generations to realise economic and development gains in the present. By unsustainably exploiting nature's resources, human civilisation has flourished but now risks substantial health effects from the degradation of nature's life support systems in the future. Health effects from changes to the environment including climatic change, ocean acidification, land degradation, water scarcity, overexploitation of fisheries, and biodiversity loss pose serious challenges to the global health gains of the past several decades and are likely to become increasingly dominant during the second half of this century and beyond. These striking trends are driven by highly inequitable, inefficient, and unsustainable patterns of resource consumption and technological development, together with population growth. We identify three categories of challenges that have to be addressed to maintain and enhance human health in the face of increasingly harmful environmental trends. Firstly, conceptual and empathy failures (imagination challenges), such as an over-reliance on gross domestic product as a measure of human progress, the failure to account for future health and environmental harms over present day gains, and the disproportionate effect of those harms on the poor and those in developing nations. Secondly, knowledge failures (research and information challenges), such as failure to address social and environmental drivers of ill health, a historical scarcity of transdisciplinary research and funding, together with an unwillingness or inability to deal with uncertainty within decision making frameworks. Thirdly, implementation failures (governance challenges), such as how governments and institutions delay recognition and responses to threats, especially when faced with uncertainties, pooled common resources, and time lags between action and effect. Although better evidence is needed to underpin appropriate policies than is available at present, this should not be used as an excuse for inaction. Substantial potential exists to link action to reduce environmental damage with improved health outcomes for nations at all levels of economic development. This Commission identifies opportunities for action by six key constituencies: health professionals, research funders and the academic community, the UN and Bretton Woods bodies, governments, investors and corporate reporting bodies, and civil society organisations. Depreciation of natural capital and nature's subsidy should be accounted for so that economy and nature are not falsely separated. Policies should balance social progress, environmental sustainability, and the economy. To support a world population of 9–10 billion people or more, resilient food and agricultural systems are needed to address both undernutrition and overnutrition, reduce waste, diversify diets, and minimise environmental damage. Meeting the need for modern family planning can improve health in the short term—eg, from reduced maternal mortality and reduced pressures on the environment and on infrastructure. Planetary health offers an unprecedented opportunity for advocacy of global and national reforms of taxes and subsidies for many sectors of the economy, including energy, agriculture, water, fisheries, and health. Regional trade treaties should act to further incorporate the protection of health in the near and long term. Several essential steps need to be taken to transform the economy to support planetary health. These steps include a reduction of waste through the creation of products that are more durable and require less energy and materials to manufacture than those often produced at present; the incentivisation of recycling, reuse, and repair; and the substitution of hazardous materials with safer alternatives. Key messages1The concept of planetary health is based on the understanding that human health and human civilisation depend on flourishing natural systems and the wise stewardship of those natural systems. However, natural systems are being degraded to an extent unprecedented in human history.2Environmental threats to human health and human civilisation will be characterised by surprise and uncertainty. Our societies face clear and potent dangers that require urgent and transformative actions to protect present and future generations.3The present systems of governance and organisation of human knowledge are inadequate to address the threats to planetary health. We call for improved governance to aid the integration of social, economic, and environmental policies and for the creation, synthesis, and application of interdisciplinary knowledge to strengthen planetary health.4Solutions lie within reach and should be based on the redefinition of prosperity to focus on the enhancement of quality of life and delivery of improved health for all, together with respect for the integrity of natural systems. This endeavour will necessitate that societies address the drivers of environmental change by promoting sustainable and equitable patterns of consumption, reducing population growth, and harnessing the power of technology for change. 1The concept of planetary health is based on the understanding that human health and human civilisation depend on flourishing natural systems and the wise stewardship of those natural systems.

Despite present limitations, the Sustainable Development Goals provide a great opportunity to integrate health and sustainability through the judicious selection of relevant indicators relevant to human wellbeing, the enabling infrastructure for development, and the supporting natural systems, together with the need for strong governance. The landscape, ecosystems, and the biodiversity they contain can be managed to protect natural systems, and indirectly, reduce human disease risk. Intact and restored ecosystems can contribute to resilience (see panel 1 for glossary of terms used in this report), for example, through improved coastal protection (eg, through wave attenuation) and the ability of floodplains and greening of river catchments to protect from river flooding events by diverting and holding excess water.Panel 1GlossaryHolocene1International Commission on StratigraphyInternational stratigraphic chart.http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2013-01.pdfDate: 2013Google ScholarA geological epoch that began about 11 700 years ago and encompasses most of the time period during which humanity has grown and developed, including all its written history and development of major civilisations.Anthropocene2Crutzen PJ Geology of mankind.Nature. 2002; 415: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google ScholarThe proposed name for a new geological epoch demarcated as the time when human activities began to have a substantial global effect on the Earth's systems.

PublicAffairs, New York2014Google Scholar “the capacity of any entity—an individual, a community, an organization, or a natural system—to prepare for disruptions, to recover from shocks and stresses, and to adapt and grow from a disruptive experience.” The growth in urban populations emphasises the importance of policies to improve health and the urban environment, such as through reduced air pollution, increased physical activity, provision of green space, and urban planning to prevent sprawl and decrease the magnitude of urban heat islands. Transdisciplinary research activities and capacity need substantial and urgent expansion. Present research limitations should not delay action. In situations where technology and knowledge can deliver win–win solutions and co-benefits, rapid scale-up can be achieved if researchers move ahead and assess the implementation of potential solutions. Recent scientific investments towards understanding non-linear state shifts in ecosystems are very important, but in the absence of improved understanding and predictability of such changes, efforts to improve resilience for human health and adaptation strategies remain a priority. The creation of integrated surveillance systems that collect rigorous health, socioeconomic, and environmental data for defined populations over long time periods can provide early detection of emerging disease outbreaks or changes in nutrition and non-communicable disease burden. The improvement of risk communication to policy makers and the public and the support of policy makers to make evidence-informed decisions can be helped by an increased capacity to do systematic reviews and the provision of rigorous policy briefs. Health professionals have an essential role in the achievement of planetary health: working across sectors to integrate policies that advance health and environmental sustainability, tackling health inequities, reducing the environmental impacts of health systems, and increasing the resilience of health systems and populations to environmental change. Humanity can be stewarded successfully through the 21st century by addressing the unacceptable inequities in health and wealth within the environmental limits of the Earth, but this will require the generation of new knowledge, implementation of wise policies, decisive action, and inspirational leadership. By most metrics, human health is better today than at any time in history. Life expectancy has soared from 47 years in 1950–1955, to 69 years in 2005–2010. Death rates in children younger than 5 years of age worldwide decreased substantially from 214 per thousand live births in 1950–1955 to 59 in 2005–2010.14You D Hug L Chen Y Wardlaw T Newby H Levels and trends in child mortality.

Humanity's progress has been supported by the Earth's ecological and biophysical systems. The Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and important ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and tundra help to maintain a constant climate, provide clean air, recycle nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, and regulate the world's water cycle, giving humanity freshwater for drinking and sanitation.3Millennium Ecosystem AssessmentEcosystems and human wellbeing: health synthesis.in: Corvalan C Hales S McMichael AJ Island Press, Washington DC2005Google Scholar The land, seas, and rivers, and the plants and animals they contain, also provide many direct goods and benefits—chiefly food, fuel, timber, and medicinal compounds (figure 1).

Here, in the first in a Series of two papers, we discuss why slums are unhealthy places with especially high risks of infection and injury. We show that children are especially vulnerable, and that the combination of malnutrition and recurrent diarrhoea leads to stunted growth and longer-term effects on cognitive development. We find that the scientific literature on slum health is underdeveloped in comparison to urban health, and poverty and health. This shortcoming is important because health is affected by factors arising from the shared physical and social environment, which have effects beyond those of poverty alone. In the second paper we will consider what can be done to improve health and make recommendations for the development of slum health as a field of study.","Slums are unhealthy environments with high risks of infection and injury, particularly for children, due to a combination of factors that go beyond poverty alone.

Williams","Sickle cell disease (SCD) is common throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, affecting up to 3% of births in some parts of the continent. Nevertheless, it remains a low priority for many health ministries. The most common form of SCD is caused by homozygosity for the β-globin S gene mutation (SS disease). It is widely believed that this condition is associated with very high child mortality, but reliable contemporary data are lacking. We have reviewed available African data on mortality associated with SS disease from published and unpublished sources, with an emphasis on two types of studies: cross-sectional population surveys and cohort studies. We have concluded that, although current data are inadequate to support definitive statements, they are consistent with an early-life mortality of 50%–90% among children born in Africa with SS disease. Inclusion of SCD interventions in child survival policies and programs in Africa could benefit from more precise estimates of numbers of deaths among children with SCD. A simple, representative, and affordable approach to estimate SCD child mortality is to test blood specimens already collected through large population surveys targeting conditions such as HIV, malaria, and malnutrition, and covering children of varying ages. Thus, although there is enough evidence to justify investments in screening, prophylaxis, and treatment for African children with SCD, better data are needed to estimate the numbers of child deaths preventable by such interventions and their cost effectiveness.","Sickle cell disease (SCD) is common in Africa, with high mortality rates among children with the severe SS form. Despite its prevalence, SCD remains underprioritized in health policies.

Ko, Sheela Patel, Smurti Jukur, Eliana Martínez‐Herrera, Saroj Jayasinghe, Siddharth Agarwal, Blaise Nguendo-Yongsi, Jane Weru, Smith Ouma, Kátia Edmundo, Tolu Oni, Hany M. Ayad","The informal settlements of the Global South are the least prepared for the pandemic of COVID-19 since basic needs such as water, toilets, sewers, drainage, waste collection, and secure and adequate housing are already in short supply or non-existent. Further, space constraints, violence, and overcrowding in slums make physical distancing and self-quarantine impractical, and the rapid spread of an infection highly likely. Residents of informal settlements are also economically vulnerable during any COVID-19 responses. Any responses to COVID-19 that do not recognize these realities will further jeopardize the survival of large segments of the urban population globally. Most top-down strategies to arrest an infectious disease will likely ignore the often-robust social groups and knowledge that already exist in many slums. Here, we offer a set of practice and policy suggestions that aim to (1) dampen the spread of COVID-19 based on the latest available science, (2) improve the likelihood of medical care for the urban poor whether or not they get infected, and (3) provide economic, social, and physical improvements and protections to the urban poor, including migrants, slum communities, and their residents, that can improve their long-term well-being. Immediate measures to protect residents of urban informal settlements, the homeless, those living in precarious settlements, and the entire population from COVID-19 include the following: (1) institute informal settlements/slum emergency planning committees in every urban informal settlement; (2) apply an immediate moratorium on evictions; (3) provide an immediate guarantee of payments to the poor; (4) immediately train and deploy community health workers; (5) immediately meet Sphere Humanitarian standards for water, sanitation, and hygiene; (6) provide immediate food assistance; (7) develop and implement a solid waste collection strategy; and (8) implement immediately a plan for mobility and health care. Lessons have been learned from earlier pandemics such as HIV and epidemics such as Ebola. They can be applied here. At the same time, the opportunity exists for public health, public administration, international aid, NGOs, and community groups to innovate beyond disaster response and move toward long-term plans.","Informal settlements in developing countries face heightened vulnerability to COVID-19 due to poor sanitation, overcrowding, and economic instability. Immediate measures are needed, including forming emergency committees, providing financial assistance, and ensuring essential services like clean water and healthcare. Long-term solutions should prioritize improving infrastructure and community well-being, drawing lessons from past pandemics and epidemics.","https://openalex.org/A5062231279, https://openalex.org/A5070343534, https://openalex.org/A5059196199, https://openalex.org/A5080817880, https://openalex.org/A5007552966, https://openalex.org/A5084197695, https://openalex.org/A5013047524, https://openalex.org/A5038349089, https://openalex.org/A5083163732, https://openalex.org/A5010055511, https://openalex.org/A5004838604, https://openalex.org/A5007801524, https://openalex.org/A5047740818, https://openalex.org/A5003572078, https://openalex.org/A5020262316, https://openalex.org/A5085242129, https://openalex.org/A5043505490, https://openalex.org/A5043311945","Jason Corburn, David Vlahov, Blessing Mberu, Lee W.

For example, in East Africa, 48 % of children under-five are stunted while 36 % are underweight. Poor health and poor nutrition are now more a characteristic of children living in the urban areas than of children in the rural areas. This is because the protective mechanism offered by the urban advantage in the past; that is, the health benefits that historically accrued to residents of cities as compared to residents in rural settings is being eroded due to increasing proportion of urban residents living in slum settings. This study sought to determine effect of mother’s education on child nutritional status of children living in slum settings. Data are from a maternal and child health project nested within the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS). The study involves 5156 children aged 0–42 months. Data on nutritional status used were collected between October 2009 and January 2010. We used binomial and multiple logistic regression to estimate the effect of education in the univariable and multivariable models respectively. Results show that close to 40 % of children in the study are stunted. Maternal education is a strong predictor of child stunting with some minimal attenuation of the association by other factors at maternal, household and community level. Other factors including at child level: child birth weight and gender; maternal level: marital status, parity, pregnancy intentions, and health seeking behaviour; and household level: social economic status are also independently significantly associated with stunting. Overall, mothers’ education persists as a strong predictor of child’s nutritional status in urban slum settings, even after controlling for other factors. Given that stunting is a strong predictor of human capital, emphasis on girl-child education may contribute to breaking the poverty cycle in urban poor settings.","In Nairobi's slums, where 40% of children are stunted, maternal education strongly predicts child's nutritional status. Education remains a significant factor even when considering other household and community factors, highlighting the importance of girl-child education in breaking the urban poverty cycle.","https://openalex.org/A5054658516, https://openalex.org/A5052633402, https://openalex.org/A5011299159","Benta Abuya, James Ciera, Elizabeth Kimani‐Murage","https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2465-0967, https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5272-616X"

The aim of this study was to shed light on the patterns of overweight and obesity in sub-Saharan Africa, with special interest in differences between the urban poor and the urban non-poor. The specific goals were to describe trends in overweight and obesity among urban women; and examine how these trends vary by education and household wealth. The paper used Demographic and Health Surveys data from seven African countries where two surveys had been carried out with an interval of at least 10 years between them. Among the countries studied, the earliest survey took place in 1992 and the latest in 2005. The dependent variable was body mass index coded as: Not overweight/obese; Overweight; Obese. The key covariates were time lapse between the two surveys; woman's education; and household wealth. Control variables included working status, age, marital status, parity, and country. Multivariate ordered logistic regression in the context of the partial proportional odds model was used. Descriptive results showed that the prevalence of urban overweight/obesity increased by nearly 35% during the period covered. The increase was higher among the poorest (+50%) than among the richest (+7%). Importantly, there was an increase of 45-50% among the non-educated and primary-educated women, compared to a drop of 10% among women with secondary education or higher. In the multivariate analysis, the odds ratio of the variable time lapse was 1.05 (p < 0.01), indicating that the prevalence of overweight/obesity increased by about 5% per year on average in the countries in the study. While the rate of change in urban overweight/obesity did not significantly differ between the poor and the rich, it was substantially higher among the non-educated women than among their educated counterparts. Overweight and obesity are on the rise in Africa and might take epidemic proportions in the near future. Like several other public health challenges, overweight and obesity should be tackled and prevented early as envisioned in the WHO Global strategy on diet, physical activity and health.","In urban sub-Saharan Africa, overweight and obesity are rising, particularly among the poorest and least educated women. While the prevalence of overweight/obesity increased by 5% annually, it increased by 50% among the poorest and 45% among non-educated women, compared to a decline among the richest and educated women.","https://openalex.org/A5045189850, https://openalex.org/A5035601211, https://openalex.org/A5066545521","Abdhalah Ziraba, Jean Christophe Fotso, Rhoune Ochako","https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3417-6536, https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7875-7001, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1732-6344"

This study was guided by the following objectives: 1) To determine the relationship between timing of first antenatal care (ANC) visit and type of delivery assistance 2) To establish the determinants of timing of first ANC visit and type delivery assistance. Data used were drawn from the 2003 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey, with a focus on young women aged 15-24. The dependent variables were: Timing of first ANC visit coded as ""None""; ""Late"" and ""Early"", and type of delivery assistance coded as ""None""; ""Traditional Birth Attendant (TBA)"" and ""Skilled professional"". Control variables included: education, household wealth, urban-rural residence, ethnicity, parity, age at birth of the last child and marital status. Multivariate ordered logistic regression model was used. The study results show that place of residence, household wealth, education, ethnicity, parity, marital status and age at birth of the last child had strong influences on timing of first ANC visit and the type of delivery assistance received. The major finding is an association between early timing of the first ANC visit and use of skilled professionals at delivery. This study confirms that timing of first antenatal care is indeed an important entry point for delivery care as young women who initiated antenatal care early were more likely to use skilled professional assistance at delivery than their counterparts who initiated ANC late. The results indicate that a large percentage of young pregnant women do not seek ANC during their first trimester as is recommended by the WHO, which may affect the type of assistance they receive during delivery. It is important that programs aimed at improving maternal health include targeting young women, especially those from rural areas, with low levels of education, higher parity and from poor households, given their high risk during pregnancy. The finding that a considerably high proportion of young women use TBAs as opposed to use of skilled professionals is baffling and calls for further research.","Among young Kenyan women, timing of first antenatal care visit influences the type of delivery assistance received, with early ANC initiation associated with skilled professional assistance at delivery. Factors such as residence, wealth, education, and parity significantly influence both ANC timing and delivery assistance type, highlighting the need to target high-risk young women, such as those in rural areas, with low education, and from poor households, for maternal health interventions.","https://openalex.org/A5066545521, https://openalex.org/A5111681211, https://openalex.org/A5111492305, https://openalex.org/A5112604842","Rhoune Ochako, Jean-Christophe Fotso, Lawrence Ikamari, Anne Khasakhala",https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1732-6344

In 2008, we estimated that 20 million influenza-virus-associated ALRI and 1 million influenza-virus-associated severe ALRI occurred in children under 5 years globally. Despite this substantial burden, only a few low-income and middle-income countries have adopted routine influenza vaccination policies for children and, where present, these have achieved only low or unknown levels of vaccine uptake. Moreover, the influenza burden might have changed due to the emergence and circulation of influenza A/H1N1pdm09. We aimed to incorporate new data to update estimates of the global number of cases, hospital admissions, and mortality from influenza-virus-associated respiratory infections in children under 5 years in 2018.","In 2018, an estimated 23 million children under 5 worldwide suffered from respiratory infections associated with seasonal influenza, leading to 2.4 million hospitalizations and 112,000 deaths. Notably, the emergence of A/H1N1pdm09 influenza has significantly impacted this burden, highlighting the need for improved influenza vaccination policies in low- and middle-income countries.","https://openalex.org/A5100328028, https://openalex.org/A5100401831, https://openalex.org/A5055802709, https://openalex.org/A5071188493, https://openalex.org/A5045971751, https://openalex.org/A5045136017, https://openalex.org/A5040800904, https://openalex.org/A5079814077, https://openalex.org/A5077438469, https://openalex.org/A5001123545, https://openalex.org/A5020678290, https://openalex.org/A5081603649, https://openalex.org/A5112282108, https://openalex.org/A5005656952, https://openalex.org/A5032056384, https://openalex.org/A5086676078, https://openalex.org/A5050709523, https://openalex.org/A5090520739, https://openalex.org/A5078271411, https://openalex.org/A5015889303, https://openalex.org/A5033213833, https://openalex.org/A5019804722, https://openalex.org/A5006759184, https://openalex.org/A5077637950, https://openalex.org/A5084579615, https://openalex.org/A5071074545, https://openalex.org/A5073936715, https://openalex.org/A5031952471, https://openalex.org/A5062204676, https://openalex.org/A5043399021, https://openalex.org/A5010134441, https://openalex.org/A5034067205, https://openalex.org/A5035343816, https://openalex.org/A5030801194, https://openalex.org/A5001090261, https://openalex.org/A5059999896, https://openalex.org/A5012945508, https://openalex.org/A5088027458, https://openalex.org/A5053638055, https://openalex.org/A5085493283, https://openalex.org/A5067805919, https://openalex.org/A5083369683, https://openalex.org/A5073903046, https://openalex.org/A5049945046, https://openalex.org/A5049605830, https://openalex.org/A5083472606, https://openalex.org/A5070568170, https://openalex.org/A5082180388, https://openalex.org/A5082180388, https://openalex.org/A5070568170, https://openalex.org/A5100328028, https://openalex.org/A5100401831, https://openalex.org/A5032056384, https://openalex.org/A5059999896, https://openalex.org/A5079814077, https://openalex.org/A5077438469, https://openalex.org/A5031009188, https://openalex.org/A5035707249, https://openalex.org/A5085101931, https://openalex.org/A5022663816, https://openalex.org/A5111666683, https://openalex.org/A5001123545, https://openalex.org/A5070665712, https://openalex.org/A5020678290, https://openalex.org/A5091610183, https://openalex.org/A5005656952, https://openalex.org/A5110944997, https://openalex.org/A5041342651, https://openalex.org/A5045971751, https://openalex.org/A5077722265, https://openalex.org/A5081603649, https://openalex.org/A5063248627, https://openalex.org/A5071534120, https://openalex.org/A5112282108, https://openalex.org/A5045561528, https://openalex.org/A5020562642, https://openalex.org/A5055802709, https://openalex.org/A5089830092, https://openalex.org/A5062953269, https://openalex.org/A5018827191, https://openalex.org/A5045136017, https://openalex.org/A5086676078, https://openalex.org/A5058553692, https://openalex.org/A5036360281, https://openalex.org/A5073903046, https://openalex.org/A5071127339, https://openalex.org/A5023140491, https://openalex.org/A5017701747, https://openalex.org/A5057503176, https://openalex.org/A5060016659, https://openalex.org/A5050709523, https://openalex.org/A5004128024, https://openalex.org/A5072616048, https://openalex.org/A5041700676, https://openalex.org/A5087609955, https://openalex.org/A5028696646, https://openalex.org/A5036593776, https://openalex.org/A5007435869, https://openalex.org/A5078271411, https://openalex.org/A5108281876","Xin Wang, You Li, Katherine L.

Lockdowns for pandemic control have health, social and economic consequences. We consider access to healthcare before and during COVID-19 with those working and living in slum communities.In seven slums in Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan, we explored stakeholder perspectives and experiences of healthcare access for non-COVID-19 conditions in two periods: pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 lockdowns.Between March 2018 and May 2020, we engaged with 860 community leaders, residents, health workers and local authority representatives. Perceived common illnesses in all sites included respiratory, gastric, waterborne and mosquitoborne illnesses and hypertension. Pre-COVID, stakeholders described various preventive, diagnostic and treatment services, including well-used antenatal and immunisation programmes and some screening for hypertension, tuberculosis, HIV and vectorborne disease. In all sites, pharmacists and patent medicine vendors were key providers of treatment and advice for minor illnesses. Mental health services and those addressing gender-based violence were perceived to be limited or unavailable. With COVID-19, a reduction in access to healthcare services was reported in all sites, including preventive services. Cost of healthcare increased while household income reduced. Residents had difficulty reaching healthcare facilities. Fear of being diagnosed with COVID-19 discouraged healthcare seeking. Alleviators included provision of healthcare by phone, pharmacists/drug vendors extending credit and residents receiving philanthropic or government support; these were inconsistent and inadequate.Slum residents' ability to seek healthcare for non-COVID-19 conditions has been reduced during lockdowns. To encourage healthcare seeking, clear communication is needed about what is available and whether infection control is in place. Policymakers need to ensure that costs do not escalate and unfairly disadvantage slum communities. Remote consulting to reduce face-to-face contact and provision of mental health and gender-based violence services should be considered.","The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have significantly reduced access to healthcare for non-COVID-19 health issues in slum communities in Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Despite pre-pandemic healthcare access challenges, including limitations in preventive services and mental health support, the pandemic has further exacerbated these issues due to increased costs, reduced income, and fear of contracting COVID-19.

Key manifestations of D&A include: physical abuse, non-consented care, non-confidential care, non-dignified care, discrimination, abandonment, and detention in facilities. This paper describes manifestations of D&A experienced in Kenya and measures their prevalence. Methods This paper is based on baseline data collected during a before-and-after study designed to measure the effect of a package of interventions to reduce the prevalence of D&A experienced by women during labor and delivery in thirteen Kenyan health facilities. Data were collected through an exit survey of 641 women discharged from postnatal wards. We present percentages of D&A manifestations and odds ratios of its relationship with demographic characteristics using a multivariate fixed effects logistic regression model. Results Twenty percent of women reported any form of D&A. Manifestations of D&A includes: non-confidential care (8.5%), non-dignified care (18%), neglect or abandonment (14.3%), Non-consensual care (4.3%) physical abuse (4.2%) and, detainment for non-payment of fees (8.1). Women aged 20-29 years were less likely to experience non-confidential care compared to those under 19; OR: [0.6 95% CI (0.36, 0.90); p=0.017]. Clients with no companion during delivery were less likely to experience inappropriate demands for payment; OR: [0.49 (0.26, 0.95); p=0.037]; while women with higher parities were three times more likely to be detained for lack of payment and five times more likely to be bribed compared to those experiencing there first birth. Conclusion One out of five women experienced feeling humiliated during labor and delivery. Six categories of D&A during childbirth in Kenya were reported. Understanding the prevalence of D&A is critical in developing interventions at national, health facility and community levels to address the factors and drivers that influence D&A in facilities and to encourage clients' future facility utilization.",Failed to generate summary,"https://openalex.org/A5022360800, https://openalex.org/A5014577157, https://openalex.org/A5039043378, https://openalex.org/A5009062360, https://openalex.org/A5012829922, https://openalex.org/A5056771501, https://openalex.org/A5056666123, https://openalex.org/A5025294702, https://openalex.org/A5055588895","Timothy Abuya, Charlotte Warren, Miller Nora, Rebecca Njuki, Charity Ndwiga, Alice Maranga, Faith Mbehero, Anne Njeru, Ben Bellows","https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8815-8299, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1361-2618, https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9926-1486, https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9205-6623"

Srinath Reddy","In 2013, the Nutrition for Growth Summit called for a Global Nutrition Report (GNR) to strengthen accountability in nutrition so that progress in reducing malnutrition could be accelerated. This article summarizes the results of the first GNR. By focusing on undernutrition and overweight, the GNR puts malnutrition in a new light. Nearly every country in the world is affected by malnutrition, and multiple malnutrition burdens are the ""new normal."" Unfortunately, the world is off track to meet the 2025 World Health Assembly (WHA) targets for nutrition. Many countries are, however, making good progress on WHA indicators, providing inspiration and guidance for others. Beyond the WHA goals, nutrition needs to be more strongly represented in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) framework. At present, it is only explicitly mentioned in 1 of 169 SDG targets despite the many contributions improved nutritional status will make to their attainment. To achieve improvements in nutrition status, it is vital to scale up nutrition programs. We identify bottlenecks in the scale-up of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive approaches and highlight actions to accelerate coverage and reach. Holding stakeholders to account for delivery on nutrition actions requires a well-functioning accountability infrastructure, which is lacking in nutrition. New accountability mechanisms need piloting and evaluation, financial resource flows to nutrition need to be made explicit, nutrition spending targets should be established, and some key data gaps need to be filled. For example, many UN member states cannot report on their WHA progress and those that can often rely on data >5 y old. The world can accelerate malnutrition reduction substantially, but this will require stronger accountability mechanisms to hold all stakeholders to account.","The Global Nutrition Report 2014 highlights the global burden of malnutrition, including undernutrition and overweight, and emphasizes that many countries are not on track to meet the 2025 World Health Assembly nutrition targets.

Cappuccio","Although there are inequalities in child health and survival in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the influence of distal determinants such as geographic location on children's nutritional status is still unclear. We investigate the impact of geographic location on child nutritional status by mapping the residual net effect of malnutrition while accounting for important risk factors. We examine spatial variation in under-five malnutrition with flexible geo-additive semi-parametric mixed model while simultaneously controlling for spatial dependence and possibly nonlinear effects of covariates within a simultaneous, coherent regression framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. Individual data records were constructed for children. Each record represents a child and consists of nutritional status information and a list of covariates. For the 8,992 children born within the last five years before the survey, 3,663 children have information on anthropometric measures. Our novel empirical approach is able to flexibly determine to what extent the substantial spatial pattern of malnutrition is driven by detectable factors such as socioeconomic factors and can be attributable to unmeasured factors such as conflicts, political, environmental and cultural factors. Although childhood malnutrition was more pronounced in all provinces of the DRC, after accounting for the location's effects, geographic differences were significant: malnutrition was significantly higher in rural areas compared to urban centres and this difference persisted after multiple adjustments. The findings suggest that models of nutritional intervention must be carefully specified with regard to residential location. Childhood malnutrition is spatially structured and rates remain very high in the provinces that rely on the mining industry and comparable to the level seen in Eastern provinces under conflicts. Even in provinces such as Bas-Congo that produce foods, childhood malnutrition is higher probably because of the economic decision to sell more than the population consumes. Improving maternal and child nutritional status is a prerequisite for achieving MDG 4, to reduce child mortality rate in the DRC.","In the Democratic Republic of Congo, malnutrition among children under five is prevalent and varies geographically. After adjusting for socioeconomic factors, malnutrition remains significantly higher in rural areas than in urban centers, emphasizing the need for location-specific interventions. Provinces dependent on the mining industry or affected by conflict have particularly high malnutrition rates, highlighting the influence of environmental and political factors.","https://openalex.org/A5101424366, https://openalex.org/A5088353901, https://openalex.org/A5018598865, https://openalex.org/A5088575958, https://openalex.org/A5015801033","Ngianga‐Bakwin Kandala, Tumwaka P Madungu, Jacques Emina, Kikhela PD Nzita, Francesco P.

In this paper we extend the theory of so-called neighbourhood effects. Slums offer high returns on investment because beneficial effects are shared across many people in densely populated neighbourhoods. Neighbourhood effects also help explain how and why the benefits of interventions vary between slum and non-slum spaces and between slums. We build on this spatial concept of slums to argue that, in all low-income and-middle-income countries, census tracts should henceforth be designated slum or non-slum both to inform local policy and as the basis for research surveys that build on censuses. We argue that slum health should be promoted as a topic of enquiry alongside poverty and health.",Improving slum health requires interventions that address both individual poverty and shared physical and social environments.

It is reported that less than 30% of urban waste in developing countries is collected and disposed appropriately. The implications of poorly managed waste on health are numerous and depend on the nature of the waste, individuals exposed, duration of exposure and availability of interventions for those exposed. To present a framework for understanding the linkages between poor solid waste management, exposure and associated adverse health outcomes. The framework will aid understanding of the relationships, interlinkages and identification of the potential points for intervention. Development of the framework was informed by a review of literature on solid waste management policies, practices and its impact on health in developing countries. A configurative synthesis of literature was applied to develop the framework. Several iterations of the framework were reviewed by experts in the field. Each linkage and outcomes are described in detail as outputs of this study. The resulting framework identifies groups of people at a heightened risk of exposure and the potential health consequences. Using the iceberg metaphor, the framework illustrates the pathways and potential burden of ill-health related to solid waste that is hidden but rapidly unfolding with our inaction. The existing evidence on the linkage between poor solid waste management and adverse health outcomes calls to action by all stakeholders in understanding, prioritizing, and addressing the issue of solid waste in our midst to ensure that our environment and health are preserved. A resulting framework developed in this study presents a clearer picture of the linkages between poor solid waste management and could guide research, policy and action.","Poor solid waste management in developing countries poses significant health risks due to increased waste generation and insufficient collection and disposal systems.

Najman, Amanuel Alemu Abajobir","Potential long-lasting adverse effects of child maltreatment have been widely reported, although little is known about the distinctive long-term impact of differing types of maltreatment. Our objective for this special article is to integrate findings from the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy, a longitudinal prenatal cohort study spanning 2 decades. We compare and contrast the associations of specific types of maltreatment with long-term cognitive, psychological, addiction, sexual health, and physical health outcomes assessed in up to 5200 offspring at 14 and/or 21 years of age. Overall, psychological maltreatment (emotional abuse and/or neglect) was associated with the greatest number of adverse outcomes in almost all areas of assessment. Sexual abuse was associated with early sexual debut and youth pregnancy, attention problems, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and depression, although associations were not specific for sexual abuse. Physical abuse was associated with externalizing behavior problems, delinquency, and drug abuse. Neglect, but not emotional abuse, was associated with having multiple sexual partners, cannabis abuse and/or dependence, and experiencing visual hallucinations. Emotional abuse, but not neglect, revealed increased odds for psychosis, injecting-drug use, experiencing harassment later in life, pregnancy miscarriage, and reporting asthma symptoms. Significant cognitive delays and educational failure were seen for both abuse and neglect during adolescence and adulthood. In conclusion, child maltreatment, particularly emotional abuse and neglect, is associated with a wide range of long-term adverse health and developmental outcomes. A renewed focus on prevention and early intervention strategies, especially related to psychological maltreatment, will be required to address these challenges in the future.",Failed to generate summary,"https://openalex.org/A5009410558, https://openalex.org/A5034128010, https://openalex.org/A5087691751, https://openalex.org/A5065763584, https://openalex.org/A5061052378, https://openalex.org/A5028564284","Lane Strathearn, Michele Giannotti, Ryan Mills, Steve Kisely, Jake M.

Most sub-Saharan countries face a double burden of traditional, persisting health challenges, such as infectious diseases, malnutrition, and child and maternal mortality, and emerging challenges from an increasing prevalence of chronic conditions, mental health disorders, injuries, and health problems related to climate change and environmental degradation. Although there has been real progress on many health indicators, life expectancy and most population health indicators remain behind most low-income and middle-income countries in other parts of the world. Africa and health: a Commission to accelerate successThe final results of a 4-year project to analyse the challenges and opportunities for health in sub-Saharan Africa are now published as a Lancet Commission—The Path to Longer and Healthier Lives for All Africans by 2030—led by African physicians, health scientists, and policy makers.1 Their conclusion is one of qualified optimism, grounded in a rigorous appraisal of new evidence and past experience. The vision of the Commission is that Africans should expect the same opportunities for health by 2030 as all other peoples.

Mutua, Steven van de Vijver, Catherine Kyobutungi","Background Many low- and middle-income countries are undergoing a nutrition transition associated with rapid social and economic transitions. We explore the coexistence of over and under- nutrition at the neighborhood and household level, in an urban poor setting in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods Data were collected in 2010 on a cohort of children aged under five years born between 2006 and 2010. Anthropometric measurements of the children and their mothers were taken. Additionally, dietary intake, physical activity, and anthropometric measurements were collected from a stratified random sample of adults aged 18 years and older through a separate cross-sectional study conducted between 2008 and 2009 in the same setting. Proportions of stunting, underweight, wasting and overweight/obesity were dettermined in children, while proportions of underweight and overweight/obesity were determined in adults. Results Of the 3335 children included in the analyses with a total of 6750 visits, 46% (51% boys, 40% girls) were stunted, 11% (13% boys, 9% girls) were underweight, 2.5% (3% boys, 2% girls) were wasted, while 9% of boys and girls were overweight/obese respectively. Among their mothers, 7.5% were underweight while 32% were overweight/obese. A large proportion (43% and 37%%) of overweight and obese mothers respectively had stunted children. Among the 5190 adults included in the analyses, 9% (6% female, 11% male) were underweight, and 22% (35% female, 13% male) were overweight/obese. Conclusion The findings confirm an existing double burden of malnutrition in this setting, characterized by a high prevalence of undernutrition particularly stunting early in life, with high levels of overweight/obesity in adulthood, particularly among women. In the context of a rapid increase in urban population, particularly in urban poor settings, this calls for urgent action. Multisectoral action may work best given the complex nature of prevailing circumstances in urban poor settings. Further research is needed to understand the pathways to this coexistence, and to test feasibility and effectiveness of context-specific interventions to curb associated health risks.",Failed to generate summary,"https://openalex.org/A5011299159, https://openalex.org/A5021773157, https://openalex.org/A5008234186, https://openalex.org/A5002685380, https://openalex.org/A5037847894, https://openalex.org/A5012389435","Elizabeth Kimani‐Murage, Stella Muthuri, Samuel Oti, Martin K.

This belief/assumption is often because of their physical proximity and assumed better access to health care services in urban areas. However, a few recent studies have cast doubt on this belief. Whether slum dwellers are better off, similar to, or worse off as compared with rural and other urban populations remain poorly understood as indicators for slum dwellers are generally hidden in urban averages.The aim of this study was to compare health and health-related indicators among slum, rural, and other urban populations in four countries where specific efforts have been made to generate health indicators specific to slum populations.We conducted a comparative analysis of health indicators among slums, non-slums, and all urban and rural populations as well as national averages in Bangladesh, Kenya, Egypt, and India. We triangulated data from demographic and health surveys, urban health surveys, and special cross-sectional slum surveys in these countries to assess differences in health indicators across the residential domains. We focused the comparisons on child health, maternal health, reproductive health, access to health services, and HIV/AIDS indicators. Within each country, we compared indicators for slums with non-slum, city/urban averages, rural, and national indicators. Between-country differences were also highlighted.In all the countries, except India, slum children had much poorer health outcomes than children in all other residential domains, including those in rural areas. Childhood illnesses and malnutrition were higher among children living in slum communities compared to those living elsewhere. Although treatment seeking was better among slum children as compared with those in rural areas, this did not translate to better mortality outcomes. They bear a disproportionately much higher mortality burden than those living elsewhere. Slum communities had higher coverage of maternal health services than rural communities but it was not possible to compare maternal mortality rates across these residential domains. Compared to rural areas, slum communities had lower fertility and higher contraceptive use rates but these differences were reversed when slums were compared to other urban populations. Slum-rural differences in infant mortality were found to be larger in Bangladesh compared to Kenya.Mortality and morbidity indicators were worse in slums than elsewhere. However, indicators of access to care and health service coverage were found to be better in slums than in rural communities.","In Bangladesh, Kenya, Egypt, and India, slum residents have poorer health outcomes than urban non-slum and rural populations, particularly regarding child health and mortality. Despite better access to healthcare services than rural areas, slum dwellers still experience higher disease burden and infant mortality. Access to maternal health services is higher in slums than rural areas, but maternal mortality comparisons are not possible.","https://openalex.org/A5059196199, https://openalex.org/A5039830570, https://openalex.org/A5012389435, https://openalex.org/A5078245614","Blessing Mberu, Tilahun Nigatu Haregu, Catherine Kyobutungi, Alex Ezeh","https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6188-196X, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8797-0469, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5344-5631, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1309-4697"

The evidence is still limited on inequalities in ASRH by gender, education, urban–rural residence and household wealth for many critical areas of sexual initiation, fertility, marriage, HIV, condom use and use of modern contraceptives for family planning. We conducted a review of published literature, a synthesis of national representative Demographic and Health Surveys data for 33 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and analyses of recent trends of 10 countries with surveys in around 2004, 2010 and 2015. Our analysis demonstrates major inequalities and uneven progress in many key ASRH indicators within sub-Saharan Africa. Gender gaps are large with little evidence of change in gaps in age at sexual debut and first marriage, resulting in adolescent girls remaining particularly vulnerable to poor sexual health outcomes. There are also major and persistent inequalities in ASRH indicators by education, urban–rural residence and economic status of the household which need to be addressed to make progress towards the goal of equity as part of the sustainable development goals and universal health coverage.

Early and unintended pregnancies among adolescents are associated with several adverse health, educational, social and economic outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify the contextual factors that influence adolescent pregnancy and early motherhood in five East African countries.We use DHS data from five East African countries to examine trends and risk factors associated with adolescent pregnancy. DHS surveys collect detailed information on individual and household characteristics, sexual behavior, contraception, and related reproductive behaviors. Our analysis focuses on a weighted subsample of adolescent's age 15-19 years (Kenya, 5820; Tanzania, 2904; Uganda, 4263; Malawi, 5263; Zambia, 3675). Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to identify the net effects of individual, household and community level contextual variables on adolescent pregnancy after adjusting for potential confounders.Adolescent pregnancy and early motherhood is common in the five countries, ranging from 18% among adolescents in Kenya (2014) to 29% in Malawi (2016) and Zambia (2014). Although all five countries experienced a decline in adolescent pregnancy since 1990, the declines have been largely inconsistent. More than half of the adolescent's most recent pregnancies and or births in these countries were unintended. The regression analysis found that educational attainment, age at first sex, household wealth, family structure and exposure to media were significantly associated with adolescent pregnancy in at least one of the five countries after adjusting for socio-demographic factors.The study highlights the importance of considering multi-sectoral approaches to addressing adolescent pregnancy. Broader development programs that have positive impacts on girls educational and employment opportunities may potentially influence their agency and decision-making around if and when to have children. Likewise, policies and programs that promote access to and uptake of adolescent sexual and reproductive health services are required to reduce barriers to the use of adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services.","Adolescent pregnancy remains a significant issue in five East African countries, with varying prevalence and trends.

Despite improvements, only three LMICs are projected to achieve the World Health Organization's Global Nutrition Target of ≥70% EBF prevalence in all subnational units by 2030, underscoring the need for targeted interventions and policies to address these inequalities.","https://openalex.org/A5089108855, https://openalex.org/A5102997269, https://openalex.org/A5031889135, https://openalex.org/A5102885553, https://openalex.org/A5001062368, https://openalex.org/A5064655150, https://openalex.org/A5064260680, https://openalex.org/A5012612516, https://openalex.org/A5081409858, https://openalex.org/A5004128917, https://openalex.org/A5001892957, https://openalex.org/A5012210914, https://openalex.org/A5072622754, https://openalex.org/A5022099745, https://openalex.org/A5073588344, https://openalex.org/A5010950335, https://openalex.org/A5024753707, https://openalex.org/A5022357996, https://openalex.org/A5055626977, https://openalex.org/A5017401934, https://openalex.org/A5089232733, https://openalex.org/A5028307745, https://openalex.org/A5051783951, https://openalex.org/A5082266211, https://openalex.org/A5071924998, https://openalex.org/A5012754346, https://openalex.org/A5034304039, https://openalex.org/A5043822651, https://openalex.org/A5072216258, https://openalex.org/A5061311900, https://openalex.org/A5081889875, https://openalex.org/A5026144627, https://openalex.org/A5063119091, https://openalex.org/A5022947458, https://openalex.org/A5113912805, https://openalex.org/A5107926219, https://openalex.org/A5048877321, https://openalex.org/A5037982462, https://openalex.org/A5066238178, https://openalex.org/A5043120571, https://openalex.org/A5009283382, https://openalex.org/A5006820691, https://openalex.org/A5112522986, https://openalex.org/A5050473276, https://openalex.org/A5011663896, https://openalex.org/A5045499794, https://openalex.org/A5017919735, https://openalex.org/A5054966669, https://openalex.org/A5014673733, https://openalex.org/A5033418795, https://openalex.org/A5072822499, https://openalex.org/A5053876771, https://openalex.org/A5041070370, https://openalex.org/A5063005562, https://openalex.org/A5031796259, https://openalex.org/A5080950348, https://openalex.org/A5082530561, https://openalex.org/A5069605540, https://openalex.org/A5083077921, https://openalex.org/A5106698278, https://openalex.org/A5069592633, https://openalex.org/A5046431472, https://openalex.org/A5061761172, https://openalex.org/A5003138186, https://openalex.org/A5014012329, https://openalex.org/A5006679078, https://openalex.org/A5019766293, https://openalex.org/A5012925236, https://openalex.org/A5067603484, https://openalex.org/A5008363918, https://openalex.org/A5063156941, https://openalex.org/A5063950280, https://openalex.org/A5078532240, https://openalex.org/A5031009188, https://openalex.org/A5059806121, https://openalex.org/A5012261253, https://openalex.org/A5077641811, https://openalex.org/A5066240466, https://openalex.org/A5056303178, https://openalex.org/A5108130731, https://openalex.org/A5076420775, https://openalex.org/A5071974745, https://openalex.org/A5029644779, https://openalex.org/A5063716572, https://openalex.org/A5063506824, https://openalex.org/A5042562991, https://openalex.org/A5027654175, https://openalex.org/A5013553497, https://openalex.org/A5007975878, https://openalex.org/A5050210882, https://openalex.org/A5048638495, https://openalex.org/A5012595484, https://openalex.org/A5070767219, https://openalex.org/A5091538451, https://openalex.org/A5019144994, https://openalex.org/A5025755632, https://openalex.org/A5075272892, https://openalex.org/A5061661012, https://openalex.org/A5003368566, https://openalex.org/A5058349987","Natalia V.

Here we map annual 2000-2018 geospatial estimates of anemia prevalence in women of reproductive age (15-49 years) across 82 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), stratify anemia by severity and aggregate results to policy-relevant administrative and national levels. Additionally, we provide subnational disparity analyses to provide a comprehensive overview of anemia prevalence inequalities within these countries and predict progress toward the World Health Organization's Global Nutrition Target (WHO GNT) to reduce anemia by half by 2030. Our results demonstrate widespread moderate improvements in overall anemia prevalence but identify only three LMICs with a high probability of achieving the WHO GNT by 2030 at a national scale, and no LMIC is expected to achieve the target in all their subnational administrative units. Our maps show where large within-country disparities occur, as well as areas likely to fall short of the WHO GNT, offering precision public health tools so that adequate resource allocation and subsequent interventions can be targeted to the most vulnerable populations.","Between 2000 and 2018, moderate improvements in anemia prevalence were observed among women of reproductive age in 82 low- and middle-income countries, but only three countries are projected to meet the World Health Organization's target of reducing anemia by half by 2030 at the national level. Subnational disparities highlight the need for targeted interventions to reach vulnerable populations and ensure progress towards this goal.","https://openalex.org/A5103543446, https://openalex.org/A5028710323, https://openalex.org/A5089108855, https://openalex.org/A5046266161, https://openalex.org/A5064655150, https://openalex.org/A5102885553, https://openalex.org/A5083150734, https://openalex.org/A5064260680, https://openalex.org/A5108711179, https://openalex.org/A5058349987, https://openalex.org/A5001062368, https://openalex.org/A5028564284, https://openalex.org/A5002423154, https://openalex.org/A5032253107, https://openalex.org/A5039236303, https://openalex.org/A5038454257, https://openalex.org/A5039134870, https://openalex.org/A5081409858, https://openalex.org/A5004128917, https://openalex.org/A5046071201, https://openalex.org/A5037397830, https://openalex.org/A5015334869, https://openalex.org/A5088337370, https://openalex.org/A5051258190, https://openalex.org/A5105821559, https://openalex.org/A5022099745, https://openalex.org/A5073588344, https://openalex.org/A5079580375, https://openalex.org/A5010950335, https://openalex.org/A5024753707, https://openalex.org/A5015436967, https://openalex.org/A5026327806, https://openalex.org/A5025832040, https://openalex.org/A5017401934, https://openalex.org/A5089232733, https://openalex.org/A5028307745, https://openalex.org/A5038241982, https://openalex.org/A5089325874, https://openalex.org/A5110919208, https://openalex.org/A5043133312, https://openalex.org/A5030523667, https://openalex.org/A5060240677, https://openalex.org/A5100647892, https://openalex.org/A5109470526, https://openalex.org/A5023902129, https://openalex.org/A5106976507, https://openalex.org/A5070575670, https://openalex.org/A5082266211, https://openalex.org/A5071924998, https://openalex.org/A5008859094, https://openalex.org/A5008914222, https://openalex.org/A5047490642, https://openalex.org/A5043822651, https://openalex.org/A5061311900, https://openalex.org/A5081889875, https://openalex.org/A5079763272, https://openalex.org/A5026144627, https://openalex.org/A5088148532, https://openalex.org/A5107926219, https://openalex.org/A5031469899, https://openalex.org/A5029961086, https://openalex.org/A5100781180, https://openalex.org/A5032637717, https://openalex.org/A5035907008, https://openalex.org/A5078832673, https://openalex.org/A5030094802, https://openalex.org/A5012235172, https://openalex.org/A5037982462, https://openalex.org/A5082114554, https://openalex.org/A5043120571, https://openalex.org/A5016293332, https://openalex.org/A5070797860, https://openalex.org/A5009283382, https://openalex.org/A5006820691, https://openalex.org/A5110997178, https://openalex.org/A5034308381, https://openalex.org/A5048448601, https://openalex.org/A5050473276, https://openalex.org/A5047221475, https://openalex.org/A5066210364, https://openalex.org/A5011663896, https://openalex.org/A5049582382, https://openalex.org/A5007517607, https://openalex.org/A5077151307, https://openalex.org/A5072019647, https://openalex.org/A5065404687, https://openalex.org/A5029960417, https://openalex.org/A5070246213, https://openalex.org/A5077743551, https://openalex.org/A5054966669, https://openalex.org/A5040188320, https://openalex.org/A5056685034, https://openalex.org/A5066643095, https://openalex.org/A5064831605, https://openalex.org/A5081686492, https://openalex.org/A5033418795, https://openalex.org/A5072822499, https://openalex.org/A5053876771, https://openalex.org/A5041070370, https://openalex.org/A5061573594","Damaris K.

Through the Countdown to 2030 for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health country collaborations, analysts from country and global public health institutions and ministries of health assessed the trends in selected services for maternal, newborn and child health, general service utilisation. Methods Monthly routine health facility data by district for the period 2017–2020 were compiled by 12 country teams and adjusted after extensive quality assessments. Mixed effects linear regressions were used to estimate the size of any change in service utilisation for each month from March to December 2020 and for the whole COVID-19 period in 2020. Results The completeness of reporting of health facilities was high in 2020 (median of 12 countries, 96% national and 91% of districts ≥90%), higher than in the preceding years and extreme outliers were few. The country median reduction in utilisation of nine health services for the whole period March–December 2020 was 3.9% (range: −8.2 to 2.4). The greatest reductions were observed for inpatient admissions (median=−17.0%) and outpatient admissions (median=−7.1%), while antenatal, delivery care and immunisation services generally had smaller reductions (median from −2% to −6%). Eastern African countries had greater reductions than those in West Africa, and rural districts were slightly more affected than urban districts. The greatest drop in services was observed for March–June 2020 for general services, when the response was strongest as measured by a stringency index. Conclusion The district health facility reports provide a solid basis for trend assessment after extensive data quality assessment and adjustment. Even the modest negative impact on service utilisation observed in most countries will require major efforts, supported by the international partners, to maintain progress towards the SDG health targets by 2030.","In 2020, a multi-country study in sub-Saharan Africa found that the COVID-19 pandemic led to a modest reduction in utilization of maternal, newborn, and child health services, with the most significant declines in inpatient and outpatient admissions. However, despite these disruptions, the overall completeness of health facility reporting remained high, indicating the robustness of the data for monitoring health service trends during the pandemic.","https://openalex.org/A5000535536, https://openalex.org/A5042682258, https://openalex.org/A5025630259, https://openalex.org/A5059155416, https://openalex.org/A5017055655, https://openalex.org/A5002685380, https://openalex.org/A5018904537, https://openalex.org/A5040046414, https://openalex.org/A5082260026, https://openalex.org/A5013758948, https://openalex.org/A5057696936, https://openalex.org/A5021065263, https://openalex.org/A5068216294, https://openalex.org/A5038640048, https://openalex.org/A5037310830, https://openalex.org/A5036883621, https://openalex.org/A5058114822, https://openalex.org/A5078236297, https://openalex.org/A5001796968, https://openalex.org/A5068973164, https://openalex.org/A5032369657, https://openalex.org/A5028100342, https://openalex.org/A5081106985, https://openalex.org/A5023153578, https://openalex.org/A5088675713, https://openalex.org/A5026746492, https://openalex.org/A5035762997, https://openalex.org/A5086063070, https://openalex.org/A5028590354, https://openalex.org/A5074887763, https://openalex.org/A5107885124, https://openalex.org/A5089440436, https://openalex.org/A5019877310, https://openalex.org/A5060472417, https://openalex.org/A5102821259, https://openalex.org/A5046502284, https://openalex.org/A5077392588, https://openalex.org/A5044991897, https://openalex.org/A5053886380, https://openalex.org/A5054082160, https://openalex.org/A5051478100, https://openalex.org/A5060647456, https://openalex.org/A5057939757, https://openalex.org/A5063663077, https://openalex.org/A5040931175, https://openalex.org/A5023177209, https://openalex.org/A5043854122, https://openalex.org/A5015566942, https://openalex.org/A5085690262, https://openalex.org/A5003504716, https://openalex.org/A5086106804, https://openalex.org/A5065354398, https://openalex.org/A5003569397, https://openalex.org/A5054381471, https://openalex.org/A5080738790, https://openalex.org/A5003385065, https://openalex.org/A5049557174, https://openalex.org/A5060782601, https://openalex.org/A5029565816, https://openalex.org/A5082130318, https://openalex.org/A5005091968, https://openalex.org/A5070035474, https://openalex.org/A5050926164, https://openalex.org/A5071342497, https://openalex.org/A5026638776, https://openalex.org/A5037936331, https://openalex.org/A5019500644, https://openalex.org/A5039029189, https://openalex.org/A5081663274, https://openalex.org/A5067418250, https://openalex.org/A5067966528, https://openalex.org/A5017581093","Agbessi Amouzou, Abdoulaye Maïga, Cheikh Fayé, Samuel Chakwera, Dessalegn Y.

We assessed the influence of socio-demographic, economic and disease-related factors in health care seeking for child illnesses among slum dwellers of Nairobi, Kenya. A survey round of the Nairobi Urban Demographic Surveillance System (NUDSS) generated information on 2-week child morbidity, illness symptoms, perceived illness severity and use of modern health services. During this round of data collection, interviewers visited a total of 15,174 households, where 3015 children younger than 5 years lived. Of the 999 (33.1%) children who were reported to have been sick, medical care of some sort was sought for 604 (60.5%). Lack of finances (49.6%) and a perception that the illness was not serious (28.1%) were the main reasons given for failure to seek health care outside the home. Health care seeking was most common for sick children in the youngest age group (0-11 months). Caretakers sought medical care more frequently for diarrhoea symptoms than for coughing and even more so when the diarrhoea was associated with fever. Perception of illness severity was strongly associated with health care seeking. Household income was significantly associated with health care seeking up to certain threshold levels, above which its effects stabilized. Improving caretaker skills to recognize danger signs in child illnesses may enhance health-seeking behaviour. Integrated Management of Child Illnesses (IMCI) programmes must be accessible free of charge to the urban poor in order to increase health care seeking and bring about improvements in child survival.","In Nairobi slums, factors influencing healthcare seeking for child illnesses include socioeconomic status, disease symptoms, and perceived illness severity. Despite the benefits of healthcare, financial constraints and perceptions of non-serious illnesses limit access to medical care, particularly for older children and those with non-diarrheal symptoms.","https://openalex.org/A5017449035, https://openalex.org/A5113580652","Negussie Taffa, Gloria Chepngeno",N/A
https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-9276-5-9,Child health inequities in developing countries: differences across urban and rural areas,Jean-Christophe Fotso,"To document and compare the magnitude of inequities in child malnutrition across urban and rural areas, and to investigate the extent to which within-urban disparities in child malnutrition are accounted for by the characteristics of communities, households and individuals.The most recent data sets available from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are used. The selection criteria were set to ensure that the number of countries, their geographical spread across Western/Central and Eastern/Southern Africa, and their socioeconomic diversities, constitute a good yardstick for the region and allow us to draw some generalizations. A household wealth index is constructed in each country and area (urban, rural), and the odds ratio between its uppermost and lowermost category, derived from multilevel logistic models, is used as a measure of socioeconomic inequalities. Control variables include mother's and father's education, community socioeconomic status (SES) designed to represent the broad socio-economic ecology of the neighborhoods in which families live, and relevant mother- and child-level covariates.Across countries in SSA, though socioeconomic inequalities in stunting do exist in both urban and rural areas, they are significantly larger in urban areas. Intra-urban differences in child malnutrition are larger than overall urban-rural differentials in child malnutrition, and there seem to be no visible relationships between within-urban inequities in child health on the one hand, and urban population growth, urban malnutrition, or overall rural-urban differentials in malnutrition, on the other. Finally, maternal and father's education, community SES and other measurable covariates at the mother and child levels only explain a slight part of the within-urban differences in child malnutrition.The urban advantage in health masks enormous disparities between the poor and the non-poor in urban areas of SSA. Specific policies geared at preferentially improving the health and nutrition of the urban poor should be implemented, so that while targeting the best attainable average level of health, reducing gaps between population groups is also on target. To successfully monitor the gaps between urban poor and non-poor, existing data collection programs such as the DHS and other nationally representative surveys should be re-designed to capture the changing patterns of the spatial distribution of population.","In developing countries, child malnutrition inequalities are greater in urban than rural areas, with substantial disparities within urban areas. Despite controlling for community, household, and individual factors, these urban disparities remain unexplained, highlighting the need for targeted policies to address the health and nutrition of the urban poor.",https://openalex.org/A5111681211,Jean-Christophe Fotso,N/A

About 71% of urban residents in Kenya live in slums. Slums are characteristically unplanned, underserved by social services, and their residents are largely underemployed and poor. Recent research shows that the urban poor fare worse than their rural counterparts on most health indicators, yet much about the health of the urban poor remains unknown. This study aims to quantify the burden of mortality of the residents in two Nairobi slums, using a Burden of Disease approach and data generated from a Demographic Surveillance System.Data from the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS) collected between January 2003 and December 2005 were analysed. Core demographic events in the NUHDSS including deaths are updated three times a year; cause of death is ascertained by verbal autopsy and cause of death is assigned according to the ICD 10 classification. Years of Life Lost due to premature mortality (YLL) were calculated by multiplying deaths in each subcategory of sex, age group and cause of death, by the Global Burden of Disease standard life expectancy at that age.The overall mortality burden per capita was 205 YLL/1,000 person years. Children under the age of five years had more than four times the mortality burden of the rest of the population, mostly due to pneumonia and diarrhoeal diseases. Among the population aged five years and above, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis accounted for about 50% of the mortality burden.Slum residents in Nairobi have a high mortality burden from preventable and treatable conditions. It is necessary to focus on these vulnerable populations since their health outcomes are comparable to or even worse than the health outcomes of rural dwellers who are often the focus of most interventions.","Residents of Nairobi's slums experience a substantial mortality burden, with children under five facing the highest risk from pneumonia and diarrheal diseases. HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis account for half of the mortality burden in adults aged five and older. These findings highlight the urgent need to prioritize health interventions for vulnerable slum populations, whose health outcomes are comparable to or worse than those of rural dwellers.","https://openalex.org/A5012389435, https://openalex.org/A5045189850, https://openalex.org/A5078245614, https://openalex.org/A5080534708","Catherine Kyobutungi, Abdhalah Ziraba, Alex Ezeh, Yazoume Yé","https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5344-5631, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3417-6536, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1309-4697, https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7851-6603"

This study relies on qualitative data collected from residents of two slums in Nairobi, Kenya in 2006 to investigate views surrounding barriers to the uptake of formal obstetric services. Data indicate that slum dwellers prefer formal to informal obstetric services. However, their efforts to utilize formal emergency obstetric care services are constrained by various factors including ineffective health decision making at the family level, inadequate transport facilities to formal care facilities and insecurity at night, high cost of health services, and inhospitable formal service providers and poorly equipped health facilities in the slums. As a result, a majority of slum dwellers opt for delivery services offered by traditional birth attendants (TBAs) who lack essential skills and equipment, thereby increasing the risk of death and disability. Based on these findings, we maintain that urban poor women face barriers to access of formal obstetric services at family, community, and health facility levels, and efforts to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality among the urban poor must tackle the barriers, which operate at these different levels to hinder women's access to formal obstetric care services. We recommend continuous community education on symptoms of complications related to pregnancy and timely referral. A focus on training of health personnel on ""public relations"" could also restore confidence in the health-care system with this populace. Further, we recommend improving the health facilities in the slums, improving the services provided by TBAs through capacity building as well as involving TBAs in referral processes to make access to services timely. Measures can also be put in place to enhance security in the slums at night.","Despite preferring formal obstetric services, slum dwellers in Nairobi face barriers to utilization, including family decision-making, lack of transportation, high costs, and poor service quality.

Nii-Amoo Dodoo, Alex Ezeh","Abstract Relatively less attention has been paid to reproductive health problems facing deprived urban residents than to those facing rural residents in sub-Saharan Africa. This is probably because the majority of Africans live in rural areas, where they are presumed to have poorer medical, educational, and other social services. Yet, the unprecedented rate of urbanization and the accompanying disproportionate growth in the proportion of poor city residents pose new challenges for health care in the region. This study examines differences in sexual behaviour between slum residents and non-slum residents in Nairobi city. The results show that slum residents start sexual intercourse at earlier ages, have more sexual partners, and are less likely than other city residents to know of or adopt preventive measures against contracting HIV/AIDS. The findings highlight the need to treat slum residents as a subpopulation uniquely vulnerable to reproductive health problems, and to expend more resources in slum settings.","A study in Nairobi, Kenya revealed that slum residents had higher rates of early sexual initiation, multiple partners, and lower knowledge and use of HIV/AIDS prevention measures compared to non-slum residents.

The objectives of this study were to determine the vaccination status of children aged between 12-23 months living in two slums of Nairobi and to identify the risk factors associated with incomplete vaccination. Methods The study was carried out as part of a longitudinal Maternal and Child Health study undertaken in Korogocho and Viwandani slums of Nairobi. These slums host the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS) run by the African Population and Health Research Centre (APHRC). All women from the NUHDSS area who gave birth since September 2006 were enrolled in the project and administered a questionnaire which asked about the vaccination history of their children. For the purpose of this study, we used data from 1848 children aged 12-23 months who were expected to have received all the WHO-recommended vaccinations. The vaccination details were collected during the first visit about four months after birth with follow-up visits repeated thereafter at four month intervals. Full vaccination was defined as receiving all the basic childhood vaccinations by the end of 24 months of life, whereas up-to-date (UTD) vaccination referred to receipt of BCG, OPV 1-3, DTP 1-3, and measles vaccinations within the first 12 months of life. All vaccination data were obtained from vaccination cards which were sighted during the household visit as well as by recall from mothers. Multivariate models were used to identify the risk factors associated with incomplete vaccination. Results Measles coverage was substantially lower than that for the other vaccines when determined using only vaccination cards or in addition to maternal recall. Up-to-date (UTD) coverage with all vaccinations at 12 months was 41.3% and 51.8% with and without the birth dose of OPV, respectively. Full vaccination coverage (57.5%) was higher than up-to-date coverage (51.8%) at 12 months overall, and in both slum settlements, using data from cards. Multivariate analysis showed that household assets and expenditure, ethnicity, place of delivery, mother's level of education, age and parity were all predictors of full vaccination among children living in the slums. Conclusions The findings show the extent to which children resident in slums are underserved with vaccination and indicate that service delivery of immunization services in the urban slums needs to be reassessed to ensure that all children are reached.","In Nairobi slums, only 41.3% of 12-23 month olds are up-to-date with vaccinations, highlighting a significant gap in coverage.

Each participating HDSS site used standardised training materials and survey instruments. Face-to-face interviews were conducted. Ethical clearance was obtained from WHO and the local ethical authority for each participating HDSS site.People aged 50 years and over in the eight participating countries represent over 15% of the current global older population, and is projected to reach 23% by 2030. The Asian HDSS sites have a larger proportion of burden of disease from non-communicable diseases and injuries relative to their African counterparts. A pooled sample of over 46,000 persons aged 50 and over from these eight HDSS sites was produced. The SAGE modules resulted in self-reported health, health status, functioning (from the WHO Disability Assessment Scale (WHODAS-II)) and well-being (from the WHO Quality of Life instrument (WHOQoL) variables). The HDSS databases contributed age, sex, marital status, education, socio-economic status and household size variables.The INDEPTH WHO-SAGE collaboration demonstrates the value and future possibilities for this type of research in informing policy and planning for a number of countries. This INDEPTH WHO-SAGE dataset will be placed in the public domain together with this open-access supplement and will be available through the GHA website (www.globalhealthaction.net) and other repositories. An improved dataset is being developed containing supplementary HDSS variables and vignette-adjusted health variables. This living collaboration is now preparing for a next wave of data collection.",Failed to generate summary,"https://openalex.org/A5039182500, https://openalex.org/A5018207897, https://openalex.org/A5045380774, https://openalex.org/A5110735042, https://openalex.org/A5085416175, https://openalex.org/A5058823173, https://openalex.org/A5074012686, https://openalex.org/A5002654671, https://openalex.org/A5081532532, https://openalex.org/A5078245614, https://openalex.org/A5008859772, https://openalex.org/A5012067466, https://openalex.org/A5006759184, https://openalex.org/A5110497005, https://openalex.org/A5005436962, https://openalex.org/A5012389435, https://openalex.org/A5066604593, https://openalex.org/A5059651488, https://openalex.org/A5111888881, https://openalex.org/A5110275499, https://openalex.org/A5056482160, https://openalex.org/A5054940158, https://openalex.org/A5022705239, https://openalex.org/A5089733556, https://openalex.org/A5045136017, https://openalex.org/A5004625557, https://openalex.org/A5014836003","Paul Kowal, Kathleen Kahn, Nawi Ng, Nirmala Naidoo, Salim Abdullah, Ayaga A.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-007-9199-x,Quality of Water the Slum Dwellers Use: The Case of a Kenyan Slum,"Elizabeth Kimani‐Murage, Augustine Ngindu","As a result of rapid urbanization in a context of economic constraints, the majority of urban residents in sub-Saharan Africa live in slums often characterized by a lack of basic services such as water and sewerage. Consequently, the urban poor often use inexpensive pit latrines and at the same time may draw domestic water from nearby wells. Overcrowding in slums limits the adequate distance between wells and pit latrines so that micro-organisms migrate from latrines to water sources. Sanitary practices in these overcrowded slums are also poor, leading to contamination of these wells. This study sought to assess sanitary practices of residents of a Kenyan urban slum and fecal contamination of their domestic water sources. This cross-sectional study involved 192 respondents from Langas slum, Kenya. Forty water samples were collected from the water sources used by the respondents for laboratory analysis of coliforms. Of these 40 samples, 31 were from shallow wells, four from deep wells, and five from taps. Multiple-tube fermentation technique was used to enumerate coliform bacteria in water. The study found that most people (91%) in the Langas slum used wells as the main source of domestic water, whereas the rest used tap water. Whereas most people used pit latrines for excreta disposal, a substantial percentage (30%) of children excreted in the open field. The estimated distance between the pit latrines and the wells was generally short with about 40% of the pit latrines being less than 15 m from the wells. The main domestic water sources were found to be highly contaminated with fecal matter. Total coliforms were found in 100% of water samples from shallow wells, while 97% of these samples from shallow wells were positive for thermotolerant coliforms. Three out of the four samples from deep wells were positive for total coliforms, while two of the four samples were positive for thermotolerant coliforms. None of the samples from taps were positive for either total or thermotolerant coliforms. Because the presence of thermotolerant coliforms in water indicates fecal contamination, facilitated by the proximity between the wells and pit latrines, the study suggests that the pit latrines were a major source of contamination of the wells with fecal matter. However, contamination through surface runoff during rains is also plausible as indiscriminate excreta disposal particularly by children was also common. Owing to the fecal contamination, there is a high possibility of the presence of disease pathogens in the water; thus, the water from the wells in Langas may not be suitable for human consumption. To address this problem, treatment of the water at community or household level and intensive behavioral change in sanitary practices are recommended. Efforts should be made to provide regulated tap water to this community and to other slums in sub-Saharan Africa where tap water is not accessible. However, more sampling of different water sources is recommended.","In a Kenyan slum, most residents draw water from shallow wells that are often contaminated with fecal matter due to proximity to pit latrines and poor sanitary practices. This contamination poses a significant health risk, as it indicates the potential presence of disease pathogens in the water. To address this issue, water treatment and improved sanitary practices are essential, as well as the provision of regulated tap water where possible.","https://openalex.org/A5011299159, https://openalex.org/A5071085020","Elizabeth Kimani‐Murage, Augustine Ngindu",https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5272-616X

This research was guided by the following questions: 1) How does women's autonomy influence the choice of place of delivery in resource-poor urban settings? 2) Does its effect vary by household wealth? and 3) To what extent does women's autonomy mediate the relationship between women's education and use of health facility for delivery?The data used is from a maternal health study carried out in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya. A total of 1,927 women (out of 2,482) who had a pregnancy outcome in 2004-2005 were selected and interviewed. Seventeen variable items on autonomy were used to construct women's decision-making, freedom of movement, and overall autonomy. Further, all health facilities serving the study population were assessed with regard to the number, training and competency of obstetric staff; services offered; physical infrastructure; and availability, adequacy and functional status of supplies and other essential equipment for safe delivery, among others. A total of 25 facilities were surveyed.While household wealth, education and demographic and health covariates had strong relationships with place of delivery, the effects of women's overall autonomy, decision-making and freedom of movement were rather weak. Among middle to least poor households, all three measures of women's autonomy were associated with place of delivery, and in the expected direction; whereas among the poorest women, they were strong and counter-intuitive. Finally, the study showed that autonomy may not be a major mediator of the link between education and use of health services for delivery.The paper argues in favor of broad actions to increase women's autonomy both as an end and as a means to facilitate improved reproductive health outcomes. It also supports the call for more appropriate data that could further support this line of action. It highlights the need for efforts to improve households' livelihoods and increase girls' schooling to alter perceptions of the value of skilled maternal health care.",Failed to generate summary,"https://openalex.org/A5109495324, https://openalex.org/A5078245614, https://openalex.org/A5021135293","Jean‐Christophe Fotso, Alex Ezeh, Hildah Essendi",https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1309-4697

Egondi, Catherine Kyobutungi, Alex Ezeh","Food and nutrition security is critical for economic development due to the role of nutrition in healthy growth and human capital development. Slum residents, already grossly affected by chronic poverty, are highly vulnerable to different forms of shocks, including those arising from political instability. This study describes the food security situation among slum residents in Nairobi, with specific focus on vulnerability associated with the 2007/2008 postelection crisis in Kenya. The study from which the data is drawn was nested within the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS), which follows about 70,000 individuals from close to 30,000 households in two slums in Nairobi, Kenya. The study triangulates data from qualitative and quantitative sources. It uses qualitative data from 10 focus group discussions with community members and 12 key-informant interviews with community opinion leaders conducted in November 2010, and quantitative data involving about 3,000 households randomly sampled from the NUHDSS database in three rounds of data collection between March 2011 and January 2012. Food security was defined using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) criteria. The study found high prevalence of food insecurity; 85 % of the households were food insecure, with 50 % being severely food insecure. Factors associated with food security include level of income, source of livelihood, household size, dependence ratio; illness, perceived insecurity and slum of residence. The qualitative narratives highlighted household vulnerability to food insecurity as commonplace but critical during times of crisis. Respondents indicated that residents in the slums generally eat for bare survival, with little concern for quality. The narratives described heightened vulnerability during the 2007/2008 postelection violence in Kenya in the perception of slum residents. Prices of staple foods like maize flour doubled and simultaneously household purchasing power was eroded due to worsened unemployment situation. The use of negative coping strategies to address food insecurity such as reducing the number of meals, reducing food variety and quality, scavenging, and eating street foods was prevalent. In conclusion, this study describes the deeply intertwined nature of chronic poverty and acute crisis, and the subsequent high levels of food insecurity in urban slum settings. Households are extremely vulnerable to food insecurity; the situation worsening during periods of crisis in the perception of slum residents, engendering frequent use of negative coping strategies. Effective response to addressing vulnerability to household food insecurity among the urban poor should focus on both the underlying vulnerabilities of households due to chronic poverty and added impacts of acute crises.",Failed to generate summary,"https://openalex.org/A5011299159, https://openalex.org/A5033093289, https://openalex.org/A5018273652, https://openalex.org/A5071521837, https://openalex.org/A5059196199, https://openalex.org/A5062191134, https://openalex.org/A5000049212, https://openalex.org/A5012389435, https://openalex.org/A5078245614","Elizabeth Kimani‐Murage, Lilly Schofield, Frederick Wekesah, Shukri F.

Health in adolescence is the result of interactions between prenatal and early childhood development and the specific biological and social-role changes that accompany puberty, shaped by social determinants and risk and protective factors that affect the uptake of health-related behaviours. The shape of adolescence is rapidly changing—the age of onset of puberty is decreasing and the age at which mature social roles are achieved is rising. Full-Text PDF Adolescence and the social determinants of healthThe health of adolescents is strongly affected by social factors at personal, family, community, and national levels. Nations present young people with structures of opportunity as they grow up. Since health and health behaviours correspond strongly from adolescence into adult life, the way that these social determinants affect adolescent health are crucial to the health of the whole population and the economic development of nations. During adolescence, developmental effects related to puberty and brain development lead to new sets of behaviours and capacities that enable transitions in family, peer, and educational domains, and in health behaviours.

In particular, urgent efforts need to focus on maternal health. Despite the lack of reliable trend data on maternal mortality, some investigators now believe that progress in maternal health has been very slow in sub-Saharan Africa. This study uses a unique combination of health facility- and individual-level data collected in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya to: (1) describe the provision of obstetric care in the Nairobi informal settlements; (2) describe the patterns of antenatal and delivery care, notably in terms of timing, frequency, and quality of care; and (3) draw policy implications aimed at improving maternal health among the rapidly growing urban poor populations. It shows that the study area is deprived of public health services, a finding which supports the view that low-income urban residents in developing countries face significant obstacles in accessing health care. This study also shows that despite the high prevalence of antenatal care (ANC), the proportion of women who made the recommended number of visits or who initiated the visit in the first trimester of pregnancy remains low compared to Nairobi as a whole and, more importantly, compared to rural populations. Bivariate analyses show that household wealth, education, parity, and place of residence were closely associated with frequency and timing of ANC and with place of delivery. Finally, there is a strong linkage between use of antenatal care and place of delivery. The findings of this study call for urgent attention by Kenya's Ministry of Health and local authorities to the void of quality health services in poor urban communities and the need to provide focused and sustained health education geared towards promoting use of obstetric services.","In Nairobi, Kenya's urban slums, maternal health services are lacking, and despite high antenatal care attendance, the frequency and timing of visits are low.

It is essential to develop and share best practices for affordable and effective community-based programs in screening and treatment of hypertension.

We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) estimates to describe the mortality burden from communicable, non-communicable, and other diseases in Ethiopia over the last 25 years. GBD 2015 mainly used cause of death ensemble modeling to measure causes of death by age, sex, and year for 195 countries. We report numbers of deaths and rates of years of life lost (YLL) for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) disorders, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and injuries with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) for Ethiopia from 1990 to 2015. CMNN causes of death have declined by 65% in the last two-and-a-half decades. Injury-related causes of death have also decreased by 70%. Deaths due to NCDs declined by 37% during the same period. Ethiopia showed a faster decline in the burden of four out of the five leading causes of age-standardized premature mortality rates when compared to the overall sub-Saharan African region and the Eastern sub-Saharan African region: lower respiratory infections, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and diarrheal diseases; however, the same could not be said for ischemic heart disease and other NCDs. Non-communicable diseases, together, were the leading causes of age-standardized mortality rates, whereas CMNN diseases were leading causes of premature mortality in 2015. Although lower respiratory infections, tuberculosis, and diarrheal disease were the leading causes of age-standardized death rates, they showed major declines from 1990 to 2015. Neonatal encephalopathy, iron-deficiency anemia, protein-energy malnutrition, and preterm birth complications also showed more than a 50% reduction in burden. HIV/AIDS-related deaths have also decreased by 70% since 2005. Ischemic heart disease, hemorrhagic stroke, and ischemic stroke were among the top causes of premature mortality and age-standardized death rates in Ethiopia in 2015. Ethiopia has been successful in reducing deaths related to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional deficiency diseases and injuries by 65%, despite unacceptably high maternal and neonatal mortality rates. However, the country’s performance regarding non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease, was minimal, causing these diseases to join the leading causes of premature mortality and death rates in 2015. While the country is progressing toward universal health coverage, prevention and control strategies in Ethiopia should consider the double burden of common infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases: lower respiratory infections, diarrhea, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Prevention and control strategies should also pay special attention to the leading causes of premature mortality and death rates caused by non-communicable diseases: cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Measuring further progress requires a data revolution in generating, managing, analyzing, and using data for decision-making and the creation of a full vital registration system in the country.","Ethiopia has made significant progress in reducing deaths from communicable diseases and injuries since 1990. However, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have emerged as a growing burden, with cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes becoming leading causes of premature mortality. The country needs to focus on addressing both the ""double burden"" of NCDs and infectious diseases through a strengthened health system and prevention strategies.","https://openalex.org/A5108472252, https://openalex.org/A5039830570, https://openalex.org/A5023797625, https://openalex.org/A5060966354, https://openalex.org/A5055734431, https://openalex.org/A5054844551, https://openalex.org/A5039387424, https://openalex.org/A5012390350, https://openalex.org/A5044414036, https://openalex.org/A5108225590, https://openalex.org/A5065980774, https://openalex.org/A5081102082, https://openalex.org/A5027621022, https://openalex.org/A5007703779, https://openalex.org/A5002839931, https://openalex.org/A5035375561, https://openalex.org/A5022723375, https://openalex.org/A5038109773, https://openalex.org/A5076553884, https://openalex.org/A5010918268","Awoke Misganaw, Tilahun Nigatu Haregu, Kebede Deribe, Gizachew Assefa Tessema, Amare Deribew, Yohannes Adama Melaku, Azmeraw T.

The 2003 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) showed that nearly 50% of unmarried women aged 15–19 and 45% of the married women reported their current pregnancies as mistimed or unwanted. The 2008–09 KDHS showed that 43% of married women in Kenya reported their current pregnancies were unintended. Unintended pregnancy is one of the most critical factors contributing to schoolgirl drop out in Kenya. Up to 13,000 Kenyan girls drop out of school every year as a result of unintended pregnancy. Unsafe pregnancy termination contributes immensely to maternal mortality which currently estimated at 488 deaths per 100 000 live births. In Kenya, the determinants of prevalence and determinants of unintended pregnancy among women in diverse social and economic situations, particularly in urban areas, are poorly understood due to lack of data. This paper addresses the prevalence and the determinants of unintended pregnancy among women in slum and non-slum settlements of Nairobi. This study used the data that was collected among a random sample of 1262 slum and non-slum women aged 15–49 years in Nairobi. The data was analyzed using simple percentages and logistic regression. The study found that 24 percent of all the women had unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of unintended pregnancy was 21 per cent among women in slum settlements compared to 27 per cent among those in non-slum settlements. Marital status, employment status, ethnicity and type of settlement were significantly associated with unintended pregnancy. Logistic analysis results indicate that age, marital status and type of settlement had statistically significantly effects on unintended pregnancy. Young women aged 15–19 were significantly more likely than older women to experience unintended pregnancy. Similarly, unmarried women showed elevated risk for unintended pregnancy than ever-married women. Women in non-slum settlements were significantly more likely to experience unintended pregnancy than their counterparts in slum settlements. The determinants of unintended pregnancy differed between women in each type of settlement. Among slum women, age, parity and marital status each had significant net effect on unintended pregnancy. But for non-slum women, it was marital status and ethnicity that had significant net effects. The study found a high prevalence of unintended pregnancy among the study population and indicated that young and unmarried women, irrespective of their educational attainment and household wealth status, have a higher likelihood of experiencing unintended pregnancy. Except for the results on educational attainments and household wealth, these results compared well with the results reported in the literature. The results indicate the need for effective programs and strategies to increase access to contraceptive services and related education, information and communication among the study population, particularly among the young and unmarried women. Increased access to family planning services is key to reducing unintended pregnancy among the study population. This calls for concerted efforts by all the stakeholders to improve access to family planning services among the study population. Increased access should be accompanied with improvement in the quality of care and availability of information about effective utilization of family planning methods.","In a study of women in Nairobi, Kenya, 24% of all women reported unintended pregnancies. Unmarried women and those in non-slum settlements had a higher risk of unintended pregnancy, and age was a significant factor for slum-dwelling women. The study highlights the need for increased access to contraceptive services and education to reduce unintended pregnancies in urban areas.","https://openalex.org/A5111492305, https://openalex.org/A5077501678, https://openalex.org/A5066545521","Lawrence Ikamari, Chimaraoke Izugbara, Rhoune Ochako","https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4908-1131, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1732-6344"

Ngware, Caroline W. Kabiru, Ngianga-Bakwin Kandala","Poverty and food insecurity continue to feature prominently in the global agenda, with particularly close attention being paid to the determinants of food insecurity. However, the effect of education is mixed and remains understudied in low income countries. Using longitudinal data collected between 2007 and 2012 in Kenya, we investigated the effect of household education attainment on food security among poor urban households. Household food security was constructed from a set of four key items while education was the average years of schooling for individuals aged 18 years and above in a household. To determine the association between education attainment and food security, we fitted a random effects generalised ordered probit model. The prevalence of severe food insecurity ranged from 49 % in 2008 to 35 % in 2012. The ordered probit results showed a significant effect of education on food security. The probability of being food insecure decreased by 0.019 for a unit increase in the average years of schooling for a given household. The effect of education, remained significant even after controlling for household wealth index, a more proximate determinant of food security in a cash-based economy such as the urban slums. The findings highlight the need to focus on the food security status of the urban poor. Specifically, results suggest the need for programs aimed at reducing food insecurity among the urban poor and enhancing household livelihoods. In addition, investment in the education of the slum households may, in the long term, contribute to reduction in the prevalence of food insecurity.","In poor Kenyan informal urban settlements from 2007-2012, a longitudinal analysis found that increased household education was significantly associated with decreased severe food insecurity. Even after accounting for wealth, education remained a protective factor, suggesting that investing in education among urban poor households may contribute to long-term food security improvements.","https://openalex.org/A5017919977, https://openalex.org/A5023240704, https://openalex.org/A5017162295, https://openalex.org/A5061329094","Maurice Mutisya, Moses W.

Browne, Charles Agyemang, Peter Agyei‐Baffour, Ama de‐Graft Aikins, Henriëtte A. Smit, Diederick E. Grobbee, Kerstin Klipstein‐Grobusch","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the most common cause of non-communicable disease mortality in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Gaps in knowledge of CVD conditions and their risk factors are important barriers in effective prevention and treatment. Yet, evidence on the awareness and knowledge level of CVD and associated risk factors among populations of SSA is scarce. This review aimed to synthesize available evidence of the level of knowledge of and perceptions towards CVDs and risk factors in the SSA region.Five databases were searched for publications up to December 2016. Narrative synthesis was conducted for knowledge level of CVDs, knowledge of risk factors and clinical signs, factors influencing knowledge of CVDs and source of health information on CVDs. The review was registered with Prospero (CRD42016049165).Of 2212 titles and abstracts screened, 45 full-text papers were retrieved and reviewed and 20 were included: eighteen quantitative and two qualitative studies. Levels of knowledge and awareness for CVD and risk factors were generally low, coupled with poor perception. Most studies reported less than half of their study participants having good knowledge of CVDs and/or risk factors. Proportion of participants who were unable to identify a single risk factor and clinical symptom for CVDs ranged from 1.8% in a study among hospital staff in Nigeria to a high of 73% in a population-based survey in Uganda and 7% among University staff in Nigeria to 75.1% in a general population in Uganda respectively. High educational attainment and place of residence had a significant influence on the levels of knowledge for CVDs among SSA populations.Low knowledge of CVDs, risk factors and clinical symptoms is strongly associated with the low levels of educational attainment and rural residency in the region. These findings provide useful information for implementers of interventions targeted at the prevention and control of CVDs, and encourages them to incorporate health promotion and awareness campaigns in order to enhance knowledge and awareness of CVDs in the region.","In sub-Saharan Africa, cardiovascular disease (CVD) knowledge and awareness are generally low, particularly among rural residents and individuals with lower education. This knowledge gap influences CVD perception, with inadequate understanding of risk factors and clinical symptoms. These findings highlight the need for targeted health campaigns to enhance CVD awareness and improve prevention efforts.","https://openalex.org/A5002775483, https://openalex.org/A5018273652, https://openalex.org/A5056142815, https://openalex.org/A5067202010, https://openalex.org/A5053933818, https://openalex.org/A5027481171, https://openalex.org/A5021915495, https://openalex.org/A5007679161, https://openalex.org/A5012933671","Daniel Boateng, Frederick Wekesah, Joyce L.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-015-0168-9,Catastrophic health expenditure and its determinants in Kenya slum communities,"Steven Buigut, Remare Ettarh, Djesika D. Amendah","In Kenya, where 60 to 80% of the urban residents live in informal settlements (frequently referred to as slums), out-of-pocket (OOP) payments account for more than a third of national health expenditures. However, little is known on the extent to which these OOP payments are associated with personal or household financial catastrophe in the slums. This paper seeks to examine the incidence and determinants of catastrophic health expenditure among urban slum communities in Kenya. We use a unique dataset on informal settlement residents in Kenya and various approaches that relate households OOP payments for healthcare to total expenditures adjusted for subsistence, or income. We classified households whose OOP was in excess of a predefined threshold as facing catastrophic health expenditures (CHE), and identified the determinants of CHE using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The results indicate that the proportion of households facing CHE varies widely between 1.52% and 28.38% depending on the method and the threshold used. A core set of variables were found to be key determinants of CHE. The number of working adults in a household and membership in a social safety net appear to reduce the risk of catastrophic expenditure. Conversely, seeking care in a public or private hospital increases the risk of CHE. This study suggests that a substantial proportion of residents of informal settlements in Kenya face CHE and would likely forgo health care they need but cannot afford. Mechanisms that pool risk and cost (insurance) are needed to protect slum residents from CHE and improve equity in health care access and payment.","In Kenyan slums, out-of-pocket health expenses can lead to catastrophic financial burdens for households. A study found that the incidence of catastrophic health expenditure varied widely, with key determinants including the number of working adults, social safety net membership, and type of healthcare facility used.
